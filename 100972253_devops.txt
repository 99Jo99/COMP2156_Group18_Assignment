This is the devops course. It is a fun course that teaches me how to navigate
through github and use the command functions on gitbash and visual studio. I
have learned many thing is in this course. It is fun and exciting. My teacher
is a fun and cool guy that I like to learn things with.

The course has many ways to teach us about the different methods to get around
using all the ways to manage and organize code and integrations tactics.
